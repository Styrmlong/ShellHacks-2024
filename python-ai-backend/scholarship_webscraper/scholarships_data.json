He was a tremendous ball of pure love, and he had a laugh that sent endorphins throughout your body making you feel better without realizing you needed it. I miss all of this and more, every single day.\nMy brother has been by my side for every important and unimportant moment in my life. He is the guy you called when you needed help fixing something, building something, needed someone to be the head chef, or just needed the company. He gladly took on any and every role, not because he had no choice, but because he loved being needed and because he needed to help, always. My husband and I walk into our home each day and think of him because of all of the ways he helped make our house our home.  \nI struggle each day to step forward because I know I have to do it without him. I’m angry because we were cheated of our time, but I am also grateful that we have spent the last 30 years making beautiful memories that I will always cherish. I am grateful that my children speak of him with so much love because that’s what my brother gave: LOVE, lots of it. \nThey say the “firsts” are hard (and they are), but when you see someone almost every day, “firsts” are daily, and the pain feels debilitating. My family and I will always be so grateful for the village of family, friends, and community who have been so supportive and present during this traumatic time.\nI want to share with you that with every ounce of perfection my brother was, he still struggled, like we all do. For years my brother put on a brave face for those around him because he never wanted to feel like a burden. He suffered from depression which he battled against every single day. \nDepression is such a taboo topic, and unfortunately, often men are made to feel and think that they are just supposed to “get over it.” While our family ensured that this was not our feelings, sadly many others cannot say the same and lack the support they need.\nIn honor of my brother, a man who never gave up and fought every day to find happiness and joy in life despite what he may have been feeling inside, we hope that anyone who is struggling can find the strength to do the same. Be a fighter like Michael. Know that you are not alone and that there is always a way to carry on. If you know someone who struggles or you find it hard to understand, educate yourself on the illness so that you can choose empathy and compassion for those that need it.\nWe have started The Michael Valdivia Scholarship Fund in memory of my brother. This will provide scholarships to male students who have struggled with depression and anxiety and have a passion to pursue an education, whether it be trade school or college. It is time to change the stigma attached to depression in males. It is not something they should ever feel shameful about, and no one should have to suffer in silence. Please help us shine a light on this by helping young men climb their mountain just as my brother did. Michael was someone who always gave back when he could, and we want to continue the legacy he leaves behind by helping others.\nThis scholarship seeks to support male students who have dealt with anxiety and/or depression and are passionate about taking the next steps to achieve their goals through the use of higher education. \nAny male high school senior or undergraduate student who has experience living with the impacts of anxiety and/or depression in their daily life may apply for this scholarship. \nTo apply, tell us about yourself, your mental health journey, and the obstacles that you’ve overcome in order to pursue your future goals of receiving an education.",
